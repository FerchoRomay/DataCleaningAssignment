# Data Cleaning assignment

## Description
This project is part of the getting and cleaning data course of the data science specialization in coursera. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project.

A script called run_analysis.R was crated. It does the following:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

+ Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
+ Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
+ Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
+ Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
+ From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## File structure
The file structure for this project separates the data between the raw_data and the transformed_data directories. Inside the raw_data, the subdirectory "UCI HAR Dataset" can be found including the downloaded data set. In the transformed_data directory the exported tidy data set can be found.

The analysis script and the markdown files were saved in the root directory.
